## 💡 The Idea
For a person new to Notion, setting up an academic database from scratch is tedious and time-consuming. With Notion-Tools, the goal is to simplify this process by giving a Notion Template which they can duplicate and access a easy to use web app. Once the setup is complete, the user can use the tools in the app to easily manage the Notion workspace without having to manually create pages & databases, edit information and setup.

## ⚙️ Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/vodnalasanthosh47/Notion-Tools.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Notion-Tools
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

Usage:

4. Start the server:
   ```
   node server.js
   ```
5. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
